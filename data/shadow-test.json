I don’t think that when we moved we even thought about the fact that people from Guam are disenfranchised and unable to vote. We’ve alway been very politically active and it never even dawned on us that we would not be able to continue voting when we moved here. So that came as a surprise.",

That means you’re not rehabilitated yet. It’s like you’re still in prison and not really a citizen on the street. What bothers me about the election is that they got Trump up there playing games. He’s not a real president type, he’s a guy who just stirs up a lot of publicity. I think we all will be in trouble if we make him president. I would take my chances with Hillary, solely based on - she’s the one who made Bill Clinton. She knows what’s going on. I know that she gets the job done.",

Looking back Bill Clinton was one of the best presidents of the US of the past 50 years. I can’t see her being much different. Obama has done a great job as well and she would be the closest and most continuation from him without major change.",

It is the only way that we will ever be treated properly by the US. The US have gotten down way too far a right-wing track - including the democrats. This neo-liberalism is nothing but republican light. Hillary Clinton is owned and operated by the big banks and big pharma. She is never going to do anything except incremental changes, which is meaningless. For the past 40 years the middle class has been disappearing. And none of the Democrats have done anything about it, except Bernie.",

To be honest, as I don’t pay US taxes, why would I have a right to vote on the US mainland? I don’t use anything in the mainland, why should I pay taxes? I would vote for anyone but Hillary. I wouldn’t vote for her if she was the last person on earth. If it happens to be Trump, it’ll be Trump. If it happens to be Cruz - I really despise Cruz, but I despise Hillary more. If Bernie Sanders happened to beat Hillary, then I would have to take a good look at him.",

I don’t want them to tell me they’ll give me free things. I want to see the strategy how to make things change. When I see Trump I feel offended and embarrassed as an American. It’s not only Americans watching him but the entire world. Hillary Clinton is more about the big banks. I wish a woman got elected. But not if it’s so crooked and dishonest. I would vote for Bernie Sanders.",
