I don’t think that when we moved we even thought about the fact that people from Guam are disenfranchised and unable to vote. We’ve alway been very politically active and it never even dawned on us that we would not be able to continue voting when we moved here. So that came as a surprise.",

Republicans seem to miss the fact that most immigrants have conservative views, but they push them away, they’re losing a huge voting block right there. Yes, certain people don’t even vote but it’s a changing America. Being from a background where you can’t do it, you’d appreciate your vote even more.",

That means you’re not rehabilitated yet. It’s like you’re still in prison and not really a citizen on the street. What bothers me about the election is that they got Trump up there playing games. He’s not a real president type, he’s a guy who just stirs up a lot of publicity. I think we all will be in trouble if we make him president. I would take my chances with Hillary, solely based on - she’s the one who made Bill Clinton. She knows what’s going on. I know that she gets the job done.",

But at the same time, when it comes down to it, she would be able to surround herself with the smartest and best people. Looking back Bill Clinton was one of the best presidents of the US of the past 50 years. I can’t see her being much different. Obama has done a great job as well and she would be the closest and most continuation from him without major change.",
